# MITRE ATT&CK matrix

Most of the  attack techniques contained in the repository's sysmon configuration are mapped to the [MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page).

The [MITRE corporation](https://www.mitre.org/) has developed a handy [ATT&CK navigator](https://github.com/mitre/attack-navigator) tool that can be used to easily navigate and annotate ATT&CK matrices. A [JSON file](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/attack_matrix/Sysmon-modular.json) is provided containing the full matrix of covered ATT&CK techniques that can be viewed in the [online navigator](https://mitre.github.io/attack-navigator/enterprise/#layerURL=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Folafhartong%2Fsysmon-modular%2Fmaster%2Fattack_matrix%2FSysmon-modular.json&scoring=false&clear_annotations=false).

**This JSON is always kept up to date and contains the latest coverage matrix.**

Viewing the matrix online is easy:
